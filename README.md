# Mega-Menu

In this project the main part is the mega menu, but apart from that I have tried to create the front page of a travel website based on India. The mega menu consists of 3 columns, which holds various information according to the requirement of the website, along with a signup form. the screenshot of the whole web-page is provided below. Thank you!!
